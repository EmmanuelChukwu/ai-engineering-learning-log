# AI Engineering Learning Log

I am transitioning into AI Engineering, with a focus on building AI-driven systems for business applications.

This repository documents my structured learning journey as I build foundational skills in:
- Python programming
- AI engineering principles
- Data handling and automation

The goal is not just to learn concepts, but to apply them through small, practical builds and clean documentation.
