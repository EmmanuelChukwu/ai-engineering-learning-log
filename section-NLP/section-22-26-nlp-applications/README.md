## Sections 22–26: NLP Applications & Text Classification

### Overview
These sections focus on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaning from text and build practical, end-to-end NLP systems. The emphasis is on understanding text structure, sentiment, themes, and classification workflows.

### What I Learned

#### 1. Parts of Speech & Named Entity Recognition
- Identifying grammatical roles of words using Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Extracting named entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and monetary values
- Understanding how structured information can be extracted from unstructured text

#### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzing text to determine emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- Understanding how sentiment analysis is used to interpret opinions in text data

#### 3. Vectorizing Text
- Converting text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models
- Understanding vectorization as the bridge between raw text and model training

#### 4. Topic Modelling
- Discovering hidden themes within large text datasets
- Grouping documents based on semantic similarity without labeled data

#### 5. Building a Text Classifier
- Combining preprocessing, vectorization, and machine learning
- Building an end-to-end NLP pipeline from raw text to predictions
