## Section 21: NLP – Text Preprocessing

### Overview
This section introduces the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a focus on text preprocessing — the process of transforming raw human language into a structured format suitable for machine learning models.

### What I Learned
- What NLP is and where it is applied in real-world systems
- Why raw text must be cleaned before being used in AI models
- Core text preprocessing techniques including:
  - Lowercasing
  - Tokenization
  - Removal of punctuation and special characters
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization
- The importance of choosing preprocessing steps based on the problem context

### Key Insights
Text preprocessing directly affects the performance of NLP models. Poor preprocessing can introduce noise, increase complexity, and reduce model accuracy, even when using advanced algorithms.

### Business Relevance
Text preprocessing is a foundational step in many business-focused AI applications, including:
- Customer review sentiment analysis
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Document classification and filtering
- Search and recommendation systems

Understanding this pipeline is critical for building reliable NLP-powered products.

### Next Steps
Applying text preprocessing techniques to real datasets and progressing toward feature extraction and NLP model building.
